API Status Codes
Status codes are returned with every request that is made to a web server.
Status codes indicate information about what happened with a request.
Here are some codes that are relevant to GET requests:

200: Everything went okay, and the result has been returned (if any).
301: The server is redirecting you to a different endpoint.
     This can happen when a company switches domain names, or an endpoint name is changed.
400: The server thinks you made a bad request.
     This can happen when you don’t send along the right data, among other things.
401: The server thinks you’re not authenticated. Many APIs require login ccredentials,
     so this happens when you don’t send the right credentials to access an API.
403: The resource you’re trying to access is forbidden: you don’t have the right permissions to see it.
404: The resource you tried to access wasn’t found on the server.
503: The server is not ready to handle the request.

Status codes that begin with a ‘4’ indicate some sort of error. The first number of status codes indicate their categorization.
This is useful — you can know that if your status code starts with a ‘2’ it was successful and if it starts with a ‘4’ or ‘5’ there was an error.
